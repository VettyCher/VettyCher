## Hi there 👋

I am a DPhil candidate in Social Data Science at the Oxford Internet Institute. My research explores strategies to counteract dehumanisation in online communication, specifically focusing on the phenomenon of re-humanisation. In the aftermath of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, I analyse linguistic facets of outgroup dehumanisation and mechanics of re-humanisation in relation to Ukrainians and Russians across digital platforms.
In addition to my PhD project, I work as an Associate Researcher and a Project Lead for the “Ukraine Case Studies” in the Portulans Institute, focusing on information and communication operations with implications for the Russian war in Ukraine and long-term global practices and policies.
